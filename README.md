# Chaning AI Models

This project will demonstration how LangChain in a Python application. The use of LangChain is to "chain" multiple machine learning models together.
The two goals of LangChain are as follows:
1. **Provide tools to automate each step of a text generation pipeline**
    `PromptTemplate` produces the final prompt that will be sent to the LM, must declare the variables to build the prompt
    
2. **Make it easier to connect tools together**
    The language models provided e.g. ChatGPT, Bard etc.

## Project Setup

The following tools are needed for this project:

1. Python 3 install
2. OpenAI + LangChain packages installed
`pip install langchain openai`
3. OpenAI API key to acces ChatGPT programatically
4. Code editor and Terminal

## Running the project

1. witch to the Python CLI with `pipenv shell` if you haven't already
2. Run `main.py` with `python main.py`
